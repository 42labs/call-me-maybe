# "But here's my number, so call me maybe"

You took your time with StarkNet <br />
But there was simply no choice <br />
L1 gave me nothing at all <br />
So I learned Cairo quick <br />
I beg and borrow and steal <br />
StarkNet works, and it's real <br />
I didn't know I would feel it <br />
But it's in my way

Uri’s stare was holdin' <br />
Ripped jeans, skin was showin' <br />
Hot night, wind was blowin' <br />
Where you think ETH’s going, baby? (To the moon!) <br />

Hey, I just bought Eth, and this is crazy <br />
But here's my option, so call Eth, maybe <br />
It's hard to buy right, in this market <br />
But here's my option, so call Eth, maybe <br />
